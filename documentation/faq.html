                     <a href="http://syriaca.org/">Syriaca.org: The Syriac Reference Portal</a> is a collaborative online research tool intended to serve a broad audience
                     including Syriac specialists, scholars in all fields, cultural heritage communities,
                     and the interested public.  Its methodological approach is informed by
                     the emerging field of <a href="http://digitalhumanities.org:8080/dhq/vol/3/1/index.html">digital humanities</a>.  As such, it differs in design from traditional
                     print reference works. The primary purpose of Syriaca.org is to serve as an online
                     hub which aids researchers by linking together print and online resources
                     for the study of Syriac literature and culture. Syriaca.org does not intend to be
                     an exhaustive reference document. Instead, the linked data structure of
                     Syriaca.org is designed to facilitate the discovery of new connections between primary
                     data and scholarship in the field.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Syriaca.org provides four basic services to its users:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>an online search tool for discovering links between existing print and digital resources</li>
                     
                     <li>new reference works for defining entities included in the Syriaca.org index of Syriac
                        studies
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>common digital standards to enable scholars to publish their own Syriac scholarship
                        online and link it to Syriaca.org
                     </li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>Because Syriaca.org relies on new ways to organize information, it differs in design
                     from previous print reference works in the humanities.  Namely the
                     chief aim of Syriaca.org is to link together existing resources, rather than to be
                     itself a comprehensive or canonical authority on factual data.

                     <h4>Why are certain important facts included or missing?</h4>
                     
                     <p>The new reference works developed by Syriaca.org (such as The Syriac Gazetteer) are
                        intended to facilitate the linking design of the project by
                        providing information for disambiguation and definition of the subject of each entry.
                        These reference works were designed with extensible frameworks
                        which allow the user community to collaboratively enrich the variety and quantity
                        of data in the database, but the primary purpose of the entries is not a
                        comprehensive or balanced overview of their subject.  Instead, the goal is for users
                        to be able to identify each entryâs subject precisely and see its
                        relationship with other entities, whether within the Syriaca.org reference tools or
                        in other datasets.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>
                        <i>The Syriac Gazetteer</i> creates a framework to allow the progressive growth of geographic information about
                        places relevant to Syriac Studies,
                        and is not intended to be a comprehensive summary of all the information (or the most
                        important information) about each of these places.  In light of
                        limited initial time and resources, we adopted a "breadth-first" rather than a "depth-first"
                        approach, consulting reference works which listed large numbers
                        of places for the purpose of creating placeholders for as many places as possible.
                        This enables <i>The Syriac Gazetteer</i> to give search results for
                        more obscure places than any previous Syriac geographical reference work.  The names,
                        descriptions, events, and bibliographic entries for the initial 
                        release were derived exclusively from the reference works we consulted for a large
                        number of places and from whatever additional works the editors
                        were consulting at that time, but they are not to be taken as the final word.  Instead,
                        their presence demonstrates the framework which enables future
                        users to add additional data with citations.  If there is a particular fact missing
                        which you would like added, it can be.
                     </p>

                     <h4>Why are most of the places not on the map?</h4>
                     
                     <p>The map includes only those places for which latitude and longitude data have been
                        entered into the database.  Places without those coordinates,
                        which are therefore not displayed on the map, fall into two categories.  Some places
                        do not have latitude and longitude because their precise locations
                        are unknown.  For example, <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/326">á¸¤arqel</a> is a place for which we have a vague prose description of its location âin
                        Palestine,â but until new evidence is discovered which allows us to identify the location
                        of this village, it cannot be placed on a map.  Nevertheless, it
                        was a place and has links to other entities within Syriaca.org, notably the author
                        Tumo of á¸¤arqel, and therefore it is included in <i>The Syriac
                           Gazetteer</i>.  Places relevant to Syriac Studies may thus be included in the database even if
                        their precise locations are unknown.  Other place records
                        do not have latitude and longitude because, although their precise location is known
                        by someone, the initial development of this reference work
                        prioritized creating a structure with as many placeholder records as possible, rather
                        than inserting more information about fewer records.  For these
                        places, users are very welcome to submit coordinates, which will cause them to appear
                        on the map and improve the reference work for everyone.

                     <h4>How is Syriaca.org different from Wikipedia?</h4>
                     
                     <p>
                        <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> is an excellent collaborative reference to general knowledge for the general public,
                        while
                        Syriaca.org aims to be an excellent collaborative reference work for the specific
                        domain of Syriac Studies, with the dual goals of enabling the research
                        of a specialist audience while remaining comprehensible to a general audience.  While
                        both reference works are collaborative, Syriaca.org is both
                        narrower and deeper in scope, and because it describes topics of specialist knowledge,
                        it uses a board of scholar-editors to vet submissions, in order
                        to maintain the verifiability of its data for academic use.  All users are encouraged
                        to submit information about the persons, places, works, and other
                        topics described by Syriaca.org with proper citation of academically trustworthy sources,
                        but scholars with a specialist knowledge in the topic will
                        review all submissions before approving them for publication.  Nevertheless, Syriaca.org
                        will never be able to compete with the volunteer workforce
                        developing Wikipedia, and so we link to the relevant Wikipedia articles as a service
                        to our users who wish to read a more developed article of general
                        knowledge.

                     <h4>Is the term "settlement" too vague, or perhaps too small, to describe major cities
                        as well as tiny villages?
                     </h4>
                     
                     <p>There are two reasons <i>The Syriac Gazetteer</i> has adopted the place type "settlement" as a catch-all rather than distinguishing
                        between
                        various sizes of settlements, large and small.  First, "settlement" already has a
                        substantial usage among digital geography projects (for examples,
                        <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/vocabularies/place-types/settlement">Pleiades</a> and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Settlement">Dbpedia.org</a>).
                        <a href="http://darmc.harvard.edu">The Digital Atlas of Roman and Medieval Civilizations</a> uses the category "Cities and Settlements" without
                        distinguishing between subcategories, which is effectively the same solution.  By
                        adopting the category of "settlement" <i>The Syriac Gazetteer</i>
                        is more easily interoperable with those other projects.  Second, and particularly
                        important when dealing with <em>historical</em> geography,
                        population centers change over time, and what was once a small village may now be
                        a major city and vice versa.  Because place types are exclusive,
                        were <i>The Syriac Gazetteer</i> to adopt size-differentiated types of settlement (e.g. metropolis, city, town, village,
                        hamlet), then it would need to
                        create distinct place records for the same place whenever it grew into a larger category
                        or shrunk into a smaller category.  Creating non-controversial
                        ways to differentiate among these place types over two millennia would be a challenge
                        matched only by our inability in almost every case to adduce
                        evidence for precisely when a settlement crossed over the boundaries of these size-differentiated
                        place types.  It has been deemed sufficient and
                        preferable, therefore, to retain a larger category of "settlement" without attempting
                        to subdivide it.

                     <h4>Why donât you have more historical maps like the <i>Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World</i> or the <i>Historical Atlas of Islam</i>?  What is a âgazetteerâ?
                     </h4>
                     
                     <p>In contrast to an atlas as a collection of maps, a gazetteer is a geographical dictionary
                        or database of places.  The distinction is significant in the
                        status accorded to places which cannot be placed on a map.  Some historical places
                        certainly existed, but their location is presently unknown.  Other
                        places were thought to exist, and were cultural objects to which most of the properties
                        of places applied, but they never existed in the sense that one
                        might arrive there, and thus they too cannot be placed on a map.  An atlas, if it
                        refers to places of these two categories at all, does so only as an
                        afterthought, since it is not able to place them on the maps, and in consequence such
                        places are usually ignored by atlas users as well.  A gazetteer,
                        by contrast, can treat them as it treats all other places, collecting references to
                        these places and the information (such as variant names, event
                        information, and prose descriptions of location) which can be gleaned from those references.
                        <i>The Syriac Gazetteer</i> recognizes the power of
                        spatial reasoning and the âspatial turnâ in several disciplines, and thus it provides
                        maps as ways to browse and search for the place records which
                        have latitude and longitude, as well as contexts in which to situate such places.
                        But because it is a work of historical and cultural geography, an
                        atlas model was felt to be too restrictive for the range of places, some unmappable,
                        which are relevant to Syriac Studies.

                     <h4>How important are diacritics, the dots or lines above or below letters?</h4>
                     
                     <p>Diacritics are used in Syriaca.org to distinguish words spelled differently in the
                        original script but otherwise spelled the same.  There is at present
                        no scholarly consensus on the transliteration of Syriac into English, so we accept
                        a range of transliteration styles at Syriaca.org, though we prefer 
                        the style specified in the preface of GEDSH.  Searching on Syriaca.org should ignore
                        diacritics and return all results with the same Latin letters.  For
                        example, searching for "Hwita" will return place <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/1342">á¸¤wÄ«á¹¯Ä</a>.  The Arabic prefix "al-" may also be omitted from
                        a search term; for example, the search string "Qaryatayn" matches the name of <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/212.html">al-Qaryatayn</a>.
                        The one exception to omitting diacritics is that the raised half-ring characters representing
                        <i>Ê¾Olaf</i> and <i>Ê¿E</i> (U+0x02BE and U+0x02BF, 
                        respectively) must be
                        included in a search term if it is present in the desired name.  Instead of the left
                        open half-ring U+0x02BF, typically representing <i>Ê¿E</i>, the
                        reader may type U+0060 (the grave accent character `) instead.  Thus searching for
                        either "ReshÊ¿ayna" or "Resh`ayna" will return the city
                        <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/172.html">ReshÊ¿ayna</a>, but searching for "Reshayna" or "Resh'ayna" will not.
