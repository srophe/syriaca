                    <p><em>A Gazetteer to John of Ephesus</em> is the second volume of <em>A Guide to John of Ephesus</em> and catalogues all the 
                        toponyms that occur in the third part of the Ecclesiastical History. It provides 
                        information on the exact location of these places, including a set of precise geographical coordinates, 
                        whenever they are known. But it also includes places John mentions without giving their exact name; in these cases, 
                        possible identifications are offered. Moreover, it briefly describes the significance of these places in the context 
                        of the <em>Ecclesiastical History</em>, lists the chapters where they are named, and gives short bibliographic references for further reading.</p>
